# Student Academic Behavior Prediction

## 📊 Big Data-Driven Attention Models

This project presents a Big Data-driven predictive analytics framework integrating machine learning and attention-based neural networks to predict student academic performance and scholarship eligibility using academic and behavioral data.

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional prediction models rely mainly on past grades and demographics. This project improves prediction accuracy by using attention-based behavioral features such as:

- Attention Stability  
- Attention Span  
- Attention Shifting  
- Attention Distribution  

A Hybrid RF-MLP model combines Random Forest and Attention-based Neural Networks to achieve higher accuracy and robustness.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Big Data-driven behavioral analysis  
- Feature engineering using attention metrics  
- Student clustering using K-Means  
- Random Forest and Attention-based MLP models  
- Hybrid ensemble prediction model  
- Scholarship eligibility prediction  

## 📈 Results

Hybrid RF-MLP Model Performance:

- Accuracy: 95.33%  
- Precision: 94.72%
